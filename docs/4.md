# üî∂ Session 13: React Router

> https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial#introduction

React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router runs anywhere React runs; on the web, on the server with node.js, and on React Native.

## ‚≠ê Installation

```
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

ho·∫∑c

```
yarn add react-router-dom@6
```

## ‚≠ê Connect the URL

First things first, we want to connect your app to the browser's URL: import BrowserRouter and render it around your whole app.

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
);
```

## ‚≠ê Add some links

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Bookkeeper</h1>
      <nav
        style={{
          borderBottom: 'solid 1px',
          paddingBottom: '1rem',
        }}
      >
        <Link to='/invoices'>Invoices</Link> | <Link to='/expenses'>Expenses</Link>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}
```
